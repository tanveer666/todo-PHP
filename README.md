# todo-PHP
My first attempt at creating a simple todo list website. 
Still a work in progress, I will continually improve upon it as I learn more.

Currently, it uses PHP for the backend and uses TWIG to display data to the HTML page
And HTTP Requests are sen by the form element.

Current Todo's: 
0) Look into docker-compose to automate the process of setting up the database 
1)Utilize AJAX for sending the data to the php scripts.
2)Possibly find a way to use Ajax to retireve data from PHP (in which case find a way for twig and ajax to coexist?)
3)A better front end ( :( )
